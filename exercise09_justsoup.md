# Minimal instructions: install the beautifulsoup4 package

If you tried to follow [the instructions for working with conda environments](https://github.com/anastassiavybornova/pythoncrashcourse/blob/main/exercise09_conda.md) but got lost on the way and just want to install the beautifulsoup4 package (we will use it in class): below you find **minimal** instructions.

* Open up your CLI **(Windows: Anaconda Prompt; macOS/linux: Terminal)**
* Try running `conda install beautifulsoup4`
* If it fails, run `pip install beautifulsoup4`
* Once installation (with conda OR pip command) is finished, run `conda list`
* Make sure that `beautifulsoup4` is in the list of packages displayed
* Run `jupyter notebook`, and start a new jupyter notebook in your browser
* In the new jupyter notebook, run: `import bs4`
* If it works: **success!**
