# Python Crash Course @ IDSP 2023

In the Python Crash Course, you learn:
* Working with Jupyter notebook
* All about Python objects (the "building blocks" of Python)
* Fundamental data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool` 
* Further data types and how to work with them: `list`, `set`, `dict`, `tuple`
* Operators (mathematical, assignment, comparison)
* Boolean logic and operations
* Conditional statements (if/else/elif)
* Loops: `for` and `while`
* Writing your own functions 
* Running Python scripts from the command line interface (CLI)
* Creating interactive Python scripts with user input
* Reading in and processing data in different file formats
* Importing, using, and creating Python modules
* Installing, importing, and using Python packages and libraries 
* Data wrangling with `pandas`
* Package management from the command line with `conda`
* Measuring the runtime of your code
* Sending HTTP requests with `requests` and webscraping with `beautifulsoup4`

Below, you find the detailed course contents, organized by lecture.

## Lecture 1
General course intro & organization.

## Lecture 2
* The Jupyter notebook interface
* Python as a calculator
* Fundamental (primitive) data types in Python
* Declaring, using, and casting variables
* Booleans
* Logical operators
* Python objects and Python operators (soft intro)

## Lecture 3
* the data type `list`
* indexing and slicing (for lists and strings)
* built-in functions (e.g. `abs(), max(), min(), sum(), len()`)
* defining your own functions
* the concept of variable scope
* conditional statements (`if, else, elif`)
* the keywords `is` and `in`

## Lecture 4
* the data types `tuple`, `set`, and `range`
* a first glance at methods (for lists and sets)
* more on lists (list methods, operations between lists)
* loops: `for` and `while`

## Lecture 5
* some new operators: **`+=`, `-=`, `%`** ...
* the data type `dict`; working with dictionaries
* the `None` object
* function parameters and function arguments

## Lecture 6
* built-in modules
* formatting strings
* string methods + sidenote on string comparisons
* the regular expressions (`re`) module
* reading and writing files with `open()`

## Lecture 7
* list comprehension
* The Shell: GUI (graphical user interface) vs. CLI (command line interface)
* Command line interface commands for Windows and macOS/linux
* Creating and running Python scripts (`.py` files)
* Interactive Python scripts with `input()`
* Absolute & relative file paths

## Lecture 8
* `seed()`ing in the random module
* (more or less) common file formats for tabular data (txt, csv, json, xlsx)
* the `pandas` package ("Excel on steroids")

## Lecture 09
* recursive functions
* the binary search algorithm
* timing your code (with the `time` module and the `%%time` cell magic in Jupyter notebook)
* then concept of environments and managing environments with `conda`

## Lecture 10
* Intro to HTML and website source code
* Sending HTTP requests with the `requests` module
* Webscraping with the `beautifulsoup4` module
